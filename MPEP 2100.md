# Patentability

## 101: Patentable Subject Matter

* ### Patent Eligibility Analysis
	* Patent-eligible subject matter categories:
		* Process - "mode of treatment of certain materials to produce a given result"
		* Machine - "concrete thing consisting of parts, or devices"
		* Manufacture - "article produced from raw or prepared materials and gives new form, qualities, or properties"
		* Composition of Matter - "compositions of 2 or more substances"
	* Claims cant be directed to judicial exception ( abstract law/ law of nature/ natural phenomenon)
		* *Alice/Mayo* 2-part test
			* see if claims are directed to judicial exception, or patent-eligible application of exception
			* if so, does the claim have additional elements that amount to significantly more than the exception
	* Four Requirements
		* 1) inventor/ discover may obtain only ONE patent per invention
		* 2) the inventor must be the applicant in the application
		* 3) claimed invention must fall in eligibly subject matter category
		* 4) claimed invention must be useful/have utility that is specific, substantial, and credible
	* Establish Broadest Reasonable Interpretation of claim
	* Non-statutory Subject Matter
		* transitory form of signal transmission
		* human
		* legal contractual agreement
		* computer program
		* mere arrangement of printed matter
		* data per se

* ### Claim Interpretation - Must be given BRI
* ### Plain Meaning - words of claim given 'plain meaning' unless defined in specifications
* ### Weight of Preamble - not given patentable weight if recites purpose/process only. Unless give
* ### Transitional phrases
	* "comprising" = "including", "containing", "specified by" - inclusive (open-ended)
	* "consisting of" - exclusive. only whats limit in claim
	* "consisting essentially of" - limit scope of claim to specified materials
* ### New use of new compound
	* claiming new use, function of product if present in prior art but not mentioned is not patentable
* ### product-by-process
	* patentability of product does not depend on method of production (process)
	* if product-by-process claim is same/ obvious from prior art, claim is unpatentable
* ### 35 USC §103 rejection and Use of Inoperative Prior Art
	* a reference is still prior art even if inoperative
	* can rely on what resource reasonably suggests to one OSiA
* ### Abandoned Application
	* can be used as prior art if properly disclosed
	* cancelled matter in application cant be used until said application is awarded patent and cancelled matter becomes available in application wrapper
* ### Printed Publications as 'Prior Art'
	* a reference is 'printed publication' if one OSiA can locate it
	* Level of public Accessibility
		* 'printed' as long as portion of public concerned with the art can locate. *i.e., thesis in university library*
		* oral papers presented to forum are 'printed' if written copies are available
		* article/publication is 'printed' on date received by first public person
* ### Genus-Species Situation
	* *a species will anticipate a clam to a genus*
* ### Anticipation of Ranges
	* range in prior art which is within a claimed range anticipates the range if it is within, overlapping, or touching and is disclosed with 'sufficient specificity'
* ### Factors Indicative of "Commercial Exploitation"
	* public use activity is premature 'commercial exploitation' of a 'completed' or nearly complete invention
	* 'On sale' status determined as follows
		* a) preparation of various 'documents'. i.ie., orders, invoices, delivery schedules
		* b) prep of price lists
		* c) display of samples to prospective customers
		* d) demo of models, eg, at trade shows
		* e) use of invention where admission fee is charges
		* f) advertising in publicity releases, brochures
		* --- even if prices are estimates, no commercial production ran, or invention never sold
	* #### Experimental Purpose
		* not public use or 'commercial exploitation' if only experimental purposes
			* testing required use of public
				* or substantial period of time
				* inventor conducted testing and inspected invention regularly
		* inventor maintained sufficient control over invention during 3rd party tests
		* developmental testing is allowed; market testing is not
* ### Inventorship
	* inventor must contribute to conception of the invention
	* must maintain intellectual domination of the work of making the invention down to the successful testing
	* inventor **not** required to reduce invention to practice
	* Joint Inventorship - have some contribution to at least one claim
	* Conception - "the complete performance of the mental part of the inventive act"
* ### Reduction to Practice
	* invention must be tested to show that it works the intended way but no need for commercial stage of development
* ### Reasonable Diligence
	*  
* ### 35 USC §103 "Obviousness"
	* steps to determine 'Obviousness'
		* determine scope and contents of prior art
		* ascertain the differences between the prior art and claims
		* resolve the level of ordinary skill in art
		* evaluate the evidence so secondary considerations
	* Must still consider:
		* claimed invention must be considered as a whole
		* references must be considered as a whole, and suggest the desirability and obviousness of making the combination
		* references must be viewed without the benefit of impermissible hindsight vision 
		* reasonable expectation of success is the standard with which obviousness is determined
	* §103 rejection requires articulation and rational such as:
		* combining prior art elements according to known methods to yield predictable results
			* 1) 
		* simple substitution of one known element for another 
		* applying a known technique to a known device 
		* 'obvious to try' - choosing from finite number of identifies predictable solutions
		* 
* ### Factors in Determining Level of Ordinary skill
	* educational level of the inventor
	* type of problems encountered in the art
	* prior art solutions
	* rapidity with which innovations are made
	* sophistication of technology
	* education level of active workers in field
* ### Pre-AIA vs AIA §102/103
	* if app filed before March 16, 2013 $\rightarrow$ pre-AIA
	* if app filed after 3/16/13, but contain claims with effective filing date prior, pre-AIA applies
	* #### AIA 102
		* 35 USC 102(a)(1) 
			* person not entitled to patent of claimed invention was patented, described in printed publication, or in public use, on sale, or available to public before effective filing date of claimed invention
		* 35 USC 102(a)(2)
			* person not entitled to patent if the claimed invention was described in patent or published application that names another inventor and effectively filed before effective filling date of claimed invention ('US Patent Documents')
			* WIPO publication of PCT international application that designates the US is also considered prior art if filed before EFD regardless of international filing date, if in English, or whether the PCT app enters the national stage in the US
				* Pre-AIA required the filing date to be on/after Nov. 29,2000 and in English
		* 35 USC 102(b)
			* set forth exceptions to prior art established in 102(a)
		* 35 USC 102(b)(1) - '1 year grace period'
			* certain disclosures made one year or less before effective filling date shall not be prior art if:
				* the disclosure was made by inventor or anyone that obtained the subject matter directly/indirectly from inventor
				* or, the subject matter disclosed, had been publicly disclosed by the inventor or anyone that obtained the subject matter...
		* 35 USC 102(b)(2)
			* (A) and (B)
				* shall not be prior art under 35 USC 102(a)(2) if:
					* the disclosure was made by inventor or anyone that obtained the subject matter directly/indirectly from inventor
					* or, the subject matter disclosed, had been publicly disclosed by the inventor or anyone that obtained the subject matter...
			* (C)
				* a disclosure made in a US patent document is not prior art under 35 USC 120(a)(2) if, not later than EFD, the subject matter disclosed and claimed invention were owned by the same person.
		* 35 USC 102(c)
			* Joint Research Agreement
		* 35 USC 102(d)
			* 'effective filing date' for prior art purposes on the earlier of:
				* actual filing date of the patent or app for patent
				* if patent/ app for patent claims benefit to the filing date of an earlier US provisional, US non provisional, PCT, or foreign patent app
		* AIA defines:
			* "claimed invention" - subject matter defined by a claim in app
			* "effective filling date" - (1) actual filing date of application: or (2) filling date of earliest provisional, non provisional, PCT, or foreign patent app that entitles app to benefit given date
			* "inventor" - individual(s) who invented the subject matter
		* pre-AIA required prior art to be in the US to qualify
			* AIA removes this geographical restraint
	* #### AIA 103 (Obviousness)
		* patent for claimed invention may not be obtained if the difference between claimed invention and prior art is that the claimed invention as a whole would have been obvious before the EFD to one OSiA
		* pre-AIA 103 was from 'time of invention' 
	* #### Survival of Pre-AIA 102(g)
		* applies to each AIA app claim if it contains/contained a claim to claimed invention with EFD before 3/16/13; or, ever designated as a continuation, divisional, or continuation-in-part of app that contained claim with EFD before 3/16/13
* #### 3 Requirements for Specification under 35 USC §112(a)
	* 1) Written Description
		* must support the subject matter in the claims
		* separate and distinct from enablement requirement
			* can have disclosure that describes the invention but no way of making it or vice versa
		* adequate written description issues
			* amendment affecting a claim
			* reliance on filing date of parent application under 35 USC §120
			* Reliance on foreign priority under 35 USC §119
			* changes to scope of claims
			* range limitations
		* claims as filed in original specifications are part of disclosure. if a claim discloses material not in remainder of specifications, the specifications must e amended to include claimed subject matter
	* 2) Enablement
		* any person skilled in the art must be able to make and use the inventions without undue experimentation
			* undue experimentation depends on factors about the claims, art, nature of invention, level of one OSiA, predictability
			* explain at least one method of making/using claimed invention
			* no need to reduce invention to practice prior to filing
			* relationship between predictability and enablement requirement
			* specification must be enabling as of filing date
			* enablement must match the scope of the claims
			* inoperative subject matter - depends if one OSiA can determine which embodiment would be inoperative/operative 
			* a feature taught as critical in specs and not recited in claims is rejected under enablement provision.
	* 3) Best mode of carrying out the claimed invention
		* safeguard agains the desire to not disclose everything
		* no need to desire which embodiment is best mode
* #### 2 Requirements for claims under 35 USC §112(b)
	* 1) claims must set forth the subject matter that applicant regards as their invention
		* 
	* 2) claims must particularly point out and distinctly define the metes and bounds of the subject matter that will be protected
		* clearly define the scope of the claims for public to know what will infringe
			* meaning of every term should be apparent
			* can define claims in anyway inventor wants as long as not contrary to meaning in the arts
			* clarity/precision
			* relative terminology
				* 'About' - clear, but flexible
				* 'Essentially' - sufficient to enable one OSiA to draw line
				* 'Similar' - indefinite
				* 'Substantially' - broad term
				* 'Type' - extends the scope of expression to render it indefinite
			* cant change what the invention is during pendency
			* numerical ranges and amounts limitations
				* narrow/broad ranges in same claim - indefinite
				* example language ('for example', 'such as') - indefinite
				* lack of antecedent basis - claim is indefinite of word/phrase has unclear meaning (unsure of which 'lever' is referred to)
				* claim can make reference to preceding claim to define a limitation if not improper or confusing
				* functional limitations - attempt to define something by what it does rather than what it is (not necessary improper)
		* Alternative Limitations
			* Markush groups - materials recited in a claim are so related as to constitute a proper markush group
			* 'Or' terminology - acceptable - 'wherein R is A,B,C, or D'; 'made entirely or in part of'; 'at least one piece'
			* 'Optionally' - 
		* Negative Limitations - nothing inherently ambiguous/ uncertain about negative limitations
		* 'Prolix' - reject claims that are unnecessarily wordy only if contain long or unimportant details that the scope of claimed invention is rendered indefinite
		* 'Multiplicity' - unreasonable number of claims in view of nature and scope of invention and state of art
		* Claim directed to Product-by-Process or Product and Process
			* Product-by-Process
				*  claims that defines the product in terms of the process in which it is made, is proper
			* Product and Process in same claim
				* claim that contains both method of use and apparatus is indefinite
				* Use Claims - claim a process without setting forth any steps involved in the process
				* omnibus claims - claim that fails to point out what is included/excluded by claim language
				* Trademarks/Trade names in claim - not, per se, improper unless name used as a identify to identify/describe a particular materials/product in claim
* #### Identifying a 35 USC §112(f) Limitation
	*  BRI that can be given to means-plus-function language is set forth in 35 USC §112(f)
	* 3 prong analysis
		* 1) claim limitation must use the phrase 'means for' or 'step for'
		* 2) 'means for' or 'step for' must be modified by functional language, and
		* 3) the phrase 'means for' or 'step for' must not be modified by structure, material or acts for achieving the specified function
	* to satisfy 112(f)
		* written description links particular structure, material, or act to the function recited in claim limitation
		* clear based on facts of app that one OSiA would know what structure, material, or act that  performs the given function
