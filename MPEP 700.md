# Examination of Applications

* ## 1. Rejection of Claims
	* Each response must be complete and address each rejection/objection
	* 'rejection' - subject matter as claimed is considered unpatentable
		* examiner is first asked to reconsider, then appeal pursued to Patent Trial Appeal Board
		* Most Rejections based on:
			* 35 USC 102 (anticipation)
			* 35 USC §103 (obviousness)
			* 35 USC §112(a) (written description, enablement, best mode)
			* 35 USC §112(b) ( particularly pointing out and distinctly claiming)
			* 35 USC §101 (patentable subject matter, lack of utility)
	* 'objection' - if form of claim, spec, or drawing is improper
		* examiner is first asked to reconsider, then petition filed to Commissioner
* ## 2. Overview of 'Prior Art' and 'Obviousness'
	* official action can: (OAR Rule)
		* <u>object</u> to a claim saying that it may/not satisfy statutory requirements, but not satisfy requirements of Patent Office Rules
		* <u>allow</u> a claim, saying that it satisfies both statutory and non-statutory requirements of patentability
		* <u>reject</u> a claim saying that it does not satisfy a specific statutory requirement with a why
	* ### A. Prior Art
		* 35 USC §102 sets up prior art
		* only what is prior art can be used to determine obviousness under §103
		* pre-AIA - prior art of preceded date of claimed invention
		* AIA - prior art if preceded date of filing or more than 1 year before filing 
	* ### B. Swearing Back (pre-AIA(a) & (e))
		* if applicant wants to overcome a prior art by showing that invention was dated before said prior art, affidavit evidence is filed
			* done on claim-by-claim basis as each can have its own invention data and effecitve filing date
	* ### C. Test
		* Determine if something is prior art
			* 1. determine invention/filing date for the claims
			* 2. find date of prior art 
			* 3. compare dates with reference to §102
* ## 3. Anticipation
	* a set of facts or reference that teaches every aspect of the claimed invention in/directly
	* if claim is anticipated cant be patented
		* examiner can be wrong in 2 ways:
			* prior art is not in fact prior art
			* examiner is wrong that prior art teaches each and every element/limitation of invention
		* applicant can also amend the claim to circumvent the prior art
	* Prior art
		* prior publication
		* prior patent
		* abandonment of invention
		* prior sale/ offer for sale
		* prior use
		* prior public/ general knowledge
		* prior invention
	* ### A. NAFTA and WTO
		* applicant can establish date of invention by acts in a NAFTA country after 12/8/93 or WTO country after 1/1/96
	* ### B. pre-AIA §102(a)
		*    | Act | Where | When |
     |---|---|---|
     | Public Knowledge | US | Prior to Invention |
     | Use by Others | US | Prior to Invention |
     | Publication | Anywhere | Prior to Invention |
     | Patent | Anywhere | Prior to Invention |
     
	* ### C. pre-AIA §102(b)
		* | Act | Where | When |
     |---|---|---|
     | Patent obtained | Anywhere | more than 1 year before filing |
     | Publication | Anywhere | more than 1 year before filing |
     | Public Use | US | more than 1 year before filing |
     | On Sale | US | more than 1 year before filing 
	 
	* ### D.  pre-AIA §102(a) , (b), and (e) contrasted 
		* §102(a) refers to date of invention
		* §102(b) refers to date of US filing
		* 3 part approach:
			* 1) determine the date of act/document as prior art. publication/other date for §102(a) and (b), earliest effective US filing date for §102(e), or invention date for §102(g)
			* 2) determine the reference date of application. invention date for §102(a), (e), (g), or filing date for (b)
			* 3) see which is earlier. if reference date preceded prior art date, rejection is invalid
	* ### E. pre-AIA §102(c)
		* prevents patenting an invention that was abandoned by inventor
	* ### F. pre-AIA §102(d)
		* prevents anyone from getting US patent on invention if **all** happen:
			* 1. same applicant or legal representative filed a foreign app for the same invention
			* 2. foreign app was filed more than 12 months before US app
			* foreign patent issued before US app was filed
	* ### G. pre-AIA §102(e)
		* 2 critical components
			* US patents or published app and PCT apps designating the US, and in English all have §102(e) dates once they publish
			* the prior art date is earliest effective US filing date or International filing date once the document has been published
	* ### H. pre-AIA §102(f)
		* prevents patenting subject matter that the applicant did not invent
	* ### I. pre-AIA §102(g)
	* ### J. AIA 102 'Race to PTO'
		* ### AIA §102(a)
			* disclosures that are public anywhere in world before EFD of app
				* #### §102(a)(1)
					* patents, printed publication, public use; on sale, or otherwise available to public 
				* #### §102(a)(2)
					* US patents, published apps, published PCT apps with EFD prior to filing date of app
					* 'may not have been visible to public at time of filing' --> later published
		* ### AIA 102(b) - exceptions
			* not prior art if disclosure was made within 1 year of filing and by inventor, or 3rd party predated by inventors own disclosure
			* #### §102(b)(1)
				* reject §102(a)(1) prior art if:
					* disclosure was made by inventor/ joint inventors, or anther that got subject matter disclosed directly/indirectly from inventor, or,
					* by 3rd party if beforehand such disclosure had been disclosed by inventor /joint inventors, or another that got subject matter disclosed directly/indirectly from inventor
			* #### §102(b)(2)
				* reject §102(a)(2) prior art if:
					* subject matter disclosed was obtained directly/indirectly from inventor(s)
					* if by 3rd party if beforehand such disclosure had been disclosed by inventor /joint inventors, or another that got subject matter disclosed directly/indirectly from inventor
					* subject matter disclosed and claimed invention, not later than EFD were owned by the same person or subject to an obligation of assignment to same person
		* ### AIA 102(c) 
			* 'common ownership'
			* in order to eliminate certain prior art under §102(a)(2)
				* subject matter disclosed was developed and claimed invention as made by, on behalf, of one or more parties to a joint research agreement that was in effect on/before EFD of claimed invention; and,
				* claimed invention was made as a result of activities undertaken within the scope of joint research agreement; and,
				* the app for patent for claimed invention discloses names of parties of joint research agreement
		* ### AIA 102(d)
			* defines what the filing date of a prior art is as of its filing date
			* only applies to US patents, published apps, and published PCT apps that designate the US
		* ### Apply AIA or pre-AIA
			* statement necessary if app contains claims that apply a mix of AIA and pre-AIA
			* otherwise no statement necessary
* ##  4. Obviousness
	* based on 35 USC §103
	* one OSiA would see obviousness based on §102 art and knowledge
	* rejection must be supported by clear articulation of reason
		* combining prior art elements according to known methods to yield predictable results
		* simple substitution of one know element for another to yield predictable results
		* use of known technique to improve similar device
		* applying a known technique to know device to yield predictable results
		* 'obvious to try'- choose from finite # of solutions, with reasonable time
		* known work in one field can prompt variation in same ot different field 
		* teaching, suggestion, motivation (TSM test) in prior art that would lead one OSiA to modify prior art 
	* #### Defeating a §103 rejection
		* examiner has burden to establish *prima facie* case of obviousness
		* defeat by:
			* establish arguments/ submission of facts that the examiner is wrong
			* submit facts which rebut the prima facie by either establishing an earlier date or establish that totality of facts show invention is not obvious
		* amendment
			* another way to overcome rejection under §102 and §103
				* include a limitation, element, step that was not in prior art or obvious, and explain how this is overcome.
				* amended claim must be supported by app as initially filed
		* factual basis of asserted arguments
			* all arguments must be based on facts present in file
* ## 5. Rejections based on New Matter
	* new subject matter is subject matter that is not supported by the original disclosure
	* no longer possible to add new matter to an application by an amendment filed with a continuation-in part application
* ## 6. Rejections under §102 - Patent-Eligible Subject Matter
	* Process, Machine, Manufacture, Composition
	* **CANT** patent
		* scientific principles/ mathematical discoveries themselves
		* atomic weapons
		* devices only for illegal use
		* method of doing business, *per se* 
		* things that are simply naturally occurring
		* purely mental method
* ## 7. Utility
	* inventions needs 'utility' to be patentable
* ## 8. Final Rejection
	* not 'final'
	* sets forth a set of rules that applicant can do next
	* limits life of app 6 months from mailing of 'final'
	* can be made 'final' anytime examiner repeats a previous rejection or makes a rejection that was necessitated by an action of the applicant. even if suspected rejection is in a continuation or substitute and the first rejection was in the parent app
	* next step:
		* put app in condition for allowance (make changes required by examiner)
		* file Notice of Appeal
		* as an alternative to responding, a continuation can be filed and the parent abandoned
	* to avoid app from being abandoned in response to Final Rejection, need 1 of 3 things:
		* response must be filed with which the examiner agrees and places the app in condition for allowance
		* Notice of Appeal is filed; or,
		* examiner converts the final action to 'non-final'
	* ### Entry
		* examiner may not file a response to Final Rejection if it raises new issues, or does not place the app in a better condition for appeal.
		* file is kept but not considered in further proceedings.
	* ### Rights after Final
		* amendments may be substituted as a matter of right if:
			* cancel claims
			* comply with requirements as to form/adopt suggestions of examiner
			* present claims in a better form for consideration 
	* ### Appeals and Continuations
		* no first action can be appealed unless in a continuation app and if rejection is same as in parent
	* ### 2 Month Rule
		* PTO covers cost for any extension they cause 
			* but applicant must respond within 2 months of final rejection
			* then 'free response' lapses at the end of 3 months of mailing of final rejection
* ## 9. Transitional Final Rejection Practice; Request for Continued Examination
	* ### Transitional Practice
		* rarely tested in bar
	* ### Request for Continued Examination (RCE)
		* replaces 53 (d) CPA
		* filing RCA cuts off 3-year pendency PTA
		* #### Requirements
			* a request (RCE)
			* submission
			* appropriate fee
			* all before:
				* payment of issue fee
				* abandonment
				* filing of court action
		* #### Submission
			* must meet reply requirements if reply to action is outstanding
			* otherwise can be IDS, amendment, new arguments/evidence

	* ## 11. Suspension of Action
		* app can petition for suspension of an action only if no action is outstanding
	* ## 12. Due Dates and Extension of Time
		* ### Basics
			* must use up automatic extensions before using extensions for cause
			* Automatic Extensions: 1,2,3,4, or 5 months
			* 6 months statutory requirement for all responses to Official Actions cannot be extended
			* time extensions are frequently necessary to make an app co-pending with its continuation/divisional to maintain EFD
			* auto extensions cant be had for 6 circumstances
				* when OA states so,
				* A Reply Brief
				* a request for an oral hearing in an Appeal
				* Responding to a decision of the Board
				* anything in an interference
				* due dates in reexaminations cannot be auto extended
			* due dates for following can not be extended even for cause:
				* IDS
				* any due date set by statute
				* issue fee can be paid late upon proper showing but not extended
				* 3-month deadline to obtain refund for a fee paid as large entity
				* filing Formal Drawings at time Issue Fee is paid
			* extension of time can be obtained in pieces
			* auto extensions provided by:
				* previous general authorization for time extensions
				* payment of extension of time fee without specific request
				* general authorization to pay any additional fee
			* #### Rules for Calculating Timeliness of Responses
				* all dates are calculated from mailing date from PTO
				* by statute all responses to OA must be filed within 6 months. can be shortened but allowed extension
				* PTO can set shortened periods for response. usually 2 months for response to restriction requirement, *Ex Parte Quayle* actions, and 3 months for all other OA
				* whenever PTO shortened response time, can be auto extended for up to 5 months provided that it is an Official Action
				* Auto extensions can be obtained retroactively
				* if due date falls on Sat, Sun or Fed. Holiday, due date is next working day the PTO is open.
				* petition for cause can only be filed in advance and not if auto extension is available
				* Auto extension can not be obtained for stated exceptions but can petition for cause
				* filing 2nd or notice of appeals may require further auto extensions
				* "two month rule" - when a response to Final Rejection is wiled within 2 months from mailing date and Office does not mail Advisory Action until after end of 3 month period set for response, the date before abandonment goes into effect is auto extended until the dat the office mails the Advisory Action or 6 month period expires
				* extension of time cannot be obtained to pay reissue fee but can be paid late 
				* when obtaining an extension of time in order to file a continuation and have parent and continuation co-pending, no response to outstanding action is required
				* extension of time to a Final Rejection extends due date for a response for filing a Notice of Appeals, and continuation
				* if app is missing parts, given 2 months from filing if no correspondence address, or 2 months from date of Notice of Missing Parts is mailed. Can extend to 5 months
				* extension fee is reduced by 50% for small entity and 75% for micro-entity
				* deadline for filing Appeal Brief is calculate from date Notice of Appeal is received by PTO even if Certificate of Mailing procedure is employed
				* papers can be filed until midnight of due date
				* 1 month=not less than 30 days / 2 months=not less than 60 days
				* Extension is necessary after an Final, even for an Examiners amendment
				* Filing a response to a Final Rejection in a re-examination auto extends the deadline for response by 1 month
				* all deadlines for appeals are set to two months
	* ## 13. Abandonment and Revival
		* can abandon app by 
			* writing to 'express abandonment'
			* or failure to take required action before given date
		* revival (withdrawal of holding of abandonment)
			* only if unintended and required a response to an action or filing of a continuation
	* ## 14. Interview
		* applicant has obligation to record in writing substance of each interview
		* rules:
			* no interview before filing
			* interview before first action is usually granted in continuing and substitute applications
			* interview after first action is considered a matter of right
			* interview after final rejection is up to examiner
			* interviews not common after appeal brief filed
			* interview does not change requirement to respond to OA
			* safe demonstrations allowed
			* no "sounding out" examiner
	* ## 15. Manner of Making Amendments in Pending Applications
		* amendment is any change which is made to specs, claims, or drawings 
		* ### Preliminary Amendment
			* before an action is issued and up to 3 months after filing
		* ### Supplemental Replies
			* reply files in follow-up to an initially filed reply considered as a matter of right and limited to:
				* cancellation of claims
				* adoption of examiner suggestions
				* placing app in condition for allowance
				* replying to office requirement after first reply
				* correct informalities
				* simplify issues on Appeal
		* ## Oaths
			* cannot be amended only supplemented/replaced
		* ## Amendment after Final
			* can be entered or refused entry
		* ## Changing Claim Wording
			* 1. cancel claim(s) and replace with new claims
				* numbers begin with next highest numbered claim previously submitted
			* 2. amend claim by 'marking up'
	* ## 16. Amendments after Notice of Allowance
		* not a matter of right
		* before issue fee is paid, amendment can be entered if needed for proper disclosure and no major work required by examiner
		* must state 4 'whys'
			* why amendment is needed
			* why no new search/consideration is required
			* why any amended/new claims are patentable
			* why the amendments were not presented earlier
		* if rejected, only option is to file for continuation
		* after payment of issue fee, no amendments are allowed except in conjunction with a withdrawal from issue
	* ## 17. Asserting an Exception under AIA §102(b) using 37 CFR 1.130
		*
