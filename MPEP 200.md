# Types, Cross-Noting, and Status of Applications
* ## National and National-stage Applications
	* 2 exceptions
		* restriction practice applies to both national and national-stage app. Unity of invention applies to national-stage apps, whereas Examiner discretion applies to separating out inventions in national apps
		* national apps filed without filing fee, oath/declaration, or translation are given filing date and sent Notice of Missing Parts. National-stage apps do not get filing date until all three are filed
* ### Inventorship
	* at least one common inventor must be shared for later filed app to get benefit from earlier filed app
	* inventors usually 'own' invention
	* most US apps are made by inventors, and then an assignment is filed to transfer invention to true owners for US patent purposes
	* inventors are listed but app files in name of owners
	* 'inventor' = contributed to 'conception'
	* 'reduction to practice' does not alter inventorship
	* corrections to inventorship can be made
* ## Provisional Applications
	* claimless, unexamined, temporary
	* specifications must satisfy ยง112(a), and include drawings
	* fee, but no oath/declaration is required
	* IDS are not permitted
		* Elements:
			* Cover sheet identifying:
				* application as provisional
				* names of inventor(s)
				* residence of inventor(s)
				* title of invention
				* name and reg # of attorney/agent
				* docket number of filer
				* correspondence address
				* specifications
				* drawings
				* filing fee
			* if missing elements, Notice of Missing Parts is sent and given 2 months to file
	* #### Utility Applications
		* if utility app is filed within 12 months after Provisional, can take priority date of provisional
		* at least one common inventor
		* if nonprovisional is not filed within 12 months, and is unintentional, can be filed within 14 months and have priority to provisional with payment of fee
	* #### Miscellaneous
		* amendments are not permitted
		* cannot be used for design patents, or interference or claim foreign priority
	* #### Conversion
		* non-provisional app can be converted to provisional with filing of petition and fee given request is made within 1 year of filing
		* can treat provisional as non-provisional if requested
	* #### The "Seven NO's"
		* no claims
		* no oath/declaration
		* no design apps
		* no possible claim for priority from other apps
		* no IDS
		* no basis for priority for design app
* ## Substitutes, Divisions, Continuations, and CIPs
	* ### Varieties of Apps
		* Regular 'Standard' Utility Application
		* Continuation - app filed by same applicant for same invention claimed in prior, non-provisional app and filed before original app becomes abandoned or patented
			* co-pending and include continuations, continuations-in-part and divisional apps
			* usually filed to start fresh after Final rejection, rather than appealing 
			* no new oath required to file continuation
		* Continuation-in-part - (CIP) 
			* similar to Continuation with repeating good portion of parent app but adds new matter 
			* can only be filed under Rule 1.53b
		* Divisional - late app that is carved out for a distinct and independent invention from pending app
			* must be co-pending
		* Substitute - same disclosure as earlier app
			* not a continuing app
	* ### Timing of Continuing Applications, Co-pendency
		* can be done at any time of prosecution or appeal if parent is still pending
		* can claim priority date of parent app
	* ### Continued Prosecution Application (CPA)
		* only for design apps
		* follows rule 1.53(d)
		* the file of parent is continued, the parent is abandoned and the CPA has the same serial number as parent and there is no reference to parent app
	* ### Naming of Inventors
		* no longer needed to obtain a filing date for apps pursuant to Rules 1.41 and 1.53
	* ### Reference Filling
* ## Priority
