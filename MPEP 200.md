# Types, Cross-Noting, and Status of Applications
* ## National and National-stage Applications
	* 2 exceptions
		* restriction practice applies to both national and national-stage app. Unity of invention applies to national-stage apps, whereas Examiner discretion applies to separating out inventions in national apps
		* national apps filed without filing fee, oath/declaration, or translation are given filing date and sent Notice of Missing Parts. Nationa-stage apps do not get filing date until all three are filed
* ### Inventorship
	* at least one common inventor must be shared for later filed app to get benefit from earlier filed app
	* inventors usually 'own' invention
	* most US apps are made by inventors, and then an assignment is filed to transfer invention to true owners for US patent purposes
	* inventors are listed but app files in name of owners
	* 'inventor' = contributed to 'conception'
	* 'reduction to practice' does not alter inventorship
	* corrections to inventorship can be made
